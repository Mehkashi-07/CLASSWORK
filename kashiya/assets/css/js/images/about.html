    <h2><b>ABOUT US </b></h2>
    Chocolate is a food made from cacao beans. It is used in many desserts like pudding, cakes, candy, ice cream, and
    Easter eggs. It can be in a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form like hot chocolate. Commercial
    chocolate has sugar and sometimes milk added. It has a melting point of about 32 °C (90 °F).

    Dark chocolate has less sugar, and a more bitter taste. It was originally used to make drinking chocolate. Chocolate
    has been around the world since the time of the Olmec, Mayan, and Aztecs.
